**Score Reducer**

The purpose of the score reducer is to maintain two lists:
- correctAnswers
- incorrectAnswers

This has two purposes:
- The user's score (correct answers vs. total answers) can be easily ascertained.
- The question / card object is stored so that the correct answer for any question 
can be easily shown.
