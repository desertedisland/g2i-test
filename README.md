Welcome to my coding challenge!

This is the React test specified at https://gist.github.com/severnsc/e09f4f8742b7dd91af9c422d6f210a57

Hopefully it's pretty straightforward: it has been built with parcel.js, 
there are not too many dependencies beyond the usual React / Jest / Babel / Eslint libraries.

#### CLI commands

`npm run dev` - build and run the project with watch enabled on port 8080

`npm run test` - run unit tests

`npm run build` - Build a production version of the app for deployment
